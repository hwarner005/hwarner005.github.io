                <p> Haley's Place was established after California's shelter-in-place order was lifted following the worldwide pandemic of 2020. While quarantined at home in order to avoid contracting the novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19, Haley began avidly cooking. Weekly menus consited of old family favorites, recipes from friends, and some help from good ol' Google. Haley's you will find many things that set us apart from your average chain restaurants. Here, we make our food from fresh ingredients. We also have some oh-so-secret sauces that you won't find anywhere else!</p>
                                
                <p> We welcome you to enjoy our delicious food and family atmosphere.</p>
